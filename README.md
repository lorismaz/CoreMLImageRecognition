This Swift app demo the use of CoreML models to detect the subject of an image.

## Requirements

* XCode 9.0 beta or +
* A model downloaded from [https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/](https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/) or [https://github.com/SwiftBrain/awesome-CoreML-models](https://github.com/SwiftBrain/awesome-CoreML-models)

## Change model

```swift
// ViewController.swift

...

guard let model = try? VNCoreMLModel(for: SqueezeNet().model)

...
```

On line 27, replace `SqueezeNet` by the model class name you wish to use. SqueezeNet is included in this repo because it is small enough.

Class name can be found here:
